# ubuntu-dotfiles
My dotfiles for Ubuntu 20.04 on an iMac14,1.

## Installation
Simply clone this repo and run the `setup.sh` script. This repo works in tandem with my [macos-dotfiles](https://github.com/7555G/macos-dotfiles), if they exist in `~/.macos-dotfiles` directory.
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/7555G/macos-dotfiles .macos-dotfiles  # optionally
git clone https://github.com/7555G/ubuntu-dotfiles .dotfiles
.dotfiles/setup.sh
```
