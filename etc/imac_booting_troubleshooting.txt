## Fix MOKList error on apple hardware by removing shim
sudo apt purge shim shim-signed
sudo rm /boot/efi/EFI/ubuntu/shimx64.efi
sudo grub-install /dev/sda
efibootmgr -v  # check changes (should be \EFI\ubuntu\grubx64.efi)
sudo update-grub  # update grub

## Cleaning up boot entries
sudo efibootmgr -Bb FFFF  # remove older entries if needed
sudo efibootmgr -t 0  # remove delay
sudo update-grub  # always update grub

## IMPORTANT: fix windows partition table from "MBR: hybrid"
## to "MBR: protective
## source: https://superuser.com/a/1536253"
sudo gdisk
# enter disk name (/dev/sda)
# something like the following should be output:
#       ...
# MBR: hybrid
# BSD: not present
# APM: not present
# GPT: present
#       ...
# enter the following commands, still in gdisk:
x  # expert
n  # create a new protective MBR
w  # write table to disk and exit (accept with "y")
# now it should be something like this:
#       ...
# MBR: protective
# BSD: not present
# APM: not present
# GPT: present
#       ...
